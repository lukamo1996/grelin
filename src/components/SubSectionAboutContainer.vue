            This website prides itself as a wannabe quasi-reddit || hackernews-alternative for the Biohacking-community. It's main focus is human-enhancement, which implies all topics surrounding nootropics, ergogenics and alike, but not body-hacking as in "Intra-cranial-stuff".<br><br>
            Grelin was mainly developed as a response to the ever-increasing shadow-banning/spamming and echo-chambers within /r/nootropics. <br><br>It therefore has the intention to provide people with a platform to discuss and research <i><b>science</b></i> and not anecdotes and "experiences". Â¨
            
            <br><br>Additionally, due to the ever-increasing censoring happening on reddit, we don't have any limitations on free-speech here. Say whatever you want.            
            Grelin is strictly scientitific unlike /r/nootropics and other forums. It's primary and overall purpose is to function as a "somewhat organized" collection of clinical studies for those pursuing human-enhancement and health-benefits. If you find bugs, dont hate me.
